On average, researchers spend about 80% of their (analytic) time on data cleaning, but we spend comparatively little teaching those skills. This course aims to fill that gap by helping researchers to (1) build their reproducible research workflow and (2) improve their data cleaning and general statistical programming skills. To that end, each session will be split to address each of these goals, with the beginning of class focused on conceptual ideas about best practices in building a workflow and the latter half focused on technical training on programming and cleaning data in R. This course will be set up as a \\\"bring your own data\\\" course to allow students to anticipate specific challenges that face different types of research. \n\nThis course is not a \\\"pure\\\" data science (i.e. we won\\'t be working with databases, etc.) because it focuses on the skills and tools most common within the social sciences. Science is a collaborative enterprise, and these tools are widely used among many social scientists, which promotes an open, equitable workflow by using tools available and most commonly used by the majority of our peers. \n\n## **Navigating Canvas:** \n\n1\\. Weekly assignments are under **Assignments**. These are due at 12:01 AM on the day of class. \n\n2\\. Reading list (and links) and links to workshop slides are under **Pages** and on the Class Quarto Site. I recommend bookmarking that site to allow you access to all materials in perpetuity.\n\n3\\. Final Project information and class participation are under Assignments**.** Be sure to familiarize yourself with due dates for the final projects. More details will be provided on the final project in the coming weeks.\n\n4\\. The most updated version of the syllabus will always be found in the \"syllabus\" folder under **Files**.\n\n## **Learning Outcomes**\n\nAfter successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\\\n1.    Build your own research workflow that can be ported to future projects. \\\n2.    Learn new programming skills that will help you efficiently, accurately, and deliberately clean and manage your data.  \\\n3.    Create a bank of code and tools that can be used for a variety of types of research. \n\nCourse Materials\n\nThere is no official textbook for this course (but if there was, it\\'d be Wickham, Cetinkaya-Rundel, & Grolemund\\'s R for Data Science \\[2nd edition\\]). However, many of you are coming in with different levels of knowledge and different types of questions, so I am providing some suggested readings below. \n\nI have arranged for students in this course to receive free access to Data Camp, a library of R (other programming languages) tutorials. Sign up using your UC Davis email [here](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/bd4b5bf66c2195741f388ca82c1b19c89b6f37754c7cfa0eb5aded5f16678360). \n\nWe will pull from the following two (freely available) books:\n\nHadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)\\\nHadley Wickham: [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) \n\n*All course materials comply with copyright/fair use policies.*\n\n## Technology Requirements\n\nThe lecture presentations, links to articles, assignments, and rubrics are located on this Canvas site for the course and on the Quarto site. To participate in learning activities and complete assignments, you will need:\n\n-   Access to a working computer that has a current operating system with updates installed;\n\n-   Reliable Internet access and a UCD email account;\n\n-   A current Internet browser that is compatible with Canvas;\n\n-   R and R Studio (see below)\n\n-   Reliable data storage for your work, such as Box, Office 365, or a USB drive.\n\nWe will do all of our data cleaning work in this class using the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) programming language. We will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to interface with R console for a more user-friendly experience.\n\n**Please install both R and RStudio before the first day of class. Here\\'s how:**\n\n1.  Get the most recent version of R (free). [Download](http://cloud.r-project.org/) the version of R compatible with your operating system (Mac, Linux, or Windows). If you are running Windows or MacOS, you should choose one of the *precompiled binary* distributions (i.e., ready-to-run applications; .exe for windows or .pkg for Mac) linked at the top of the R Project\\'s webpage.\n\n2.  Once R is installed, [download and install R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (soon to be Pivot). R Studio is an \\\"Integrated Development Environment\\\", or IDE. This means it is a front-end for R that makes it much easier to work with. R Studio is also free, and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.\n\n3.  [Install the tidyverse library](http://tidyverse.org/) and several other add-on packages for R. These are sets of tolls or functions that will aid us in cleaning and wrangling data, and more. This is a non-exhaustive list that will get us started.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_packages <- c(\n  \"plyr\", \"tidyverse\", \"furrr\", \"broom\",\n  \"MASS\", \"quantreg\", \"rlang\", \"scales\",\n  \"survey\", \"srvyr\", \"devtools\", \"future\"\n)\n\ninstall.packages(my_packages, repos = \"http://cran.rstudio.com\")\n```\n:::\n",
