Welcome & Q's on homework\n2.  Part 1: Data Quality and Descriptives\n3.  Part 2: `tidyr`\n4.  Problem set & Q time\n\n# DATA QUALITY\n\n## What is data quality\n\n[IBM's](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-quality#:~:text=the%20next%20step-,What%20is%20data%20quality%3F,governance%20initiatives%20within%20an%20organization.) definition of data quality:\n\n> \"Data quality measures how well a dataset meets criteria for accuracy, completeness, validity, consistency, uniqueness, timeliness, and fitness for purpose\"\n\n## Aspects of data quality\n\n-   **Accuracy**: Do the data reflect reality / truth?\n-   **Completeness**: Are the data usable or complete (no missing people, values, etc. beyond random)\\\n-   **Uniqueness**: There is no duplicated data\n-   **Validity**: Do the data have the correct properties (values, ranges, etc.)\n-   **Consistency**: When integrating across multiple data sources, information should converge across sources and match reality\n-   **Timeliness**: Can the data be maintained and distributed within a specified time frame\n-   **Fitness for purpose**: Do the data meet your research need?\n\n## Why should we care about data quality\n\n-   You aren't responsible for poor quality data you receive, but you are responsible for the data products you work with -- that is, you are responsible for improving data quality\n-   Poor quality data threatens scientific integrity\\\n-   Poor quality data are a pain for you to work with and for others to work with\n\n## What can data quality do for my career?\n\n-   The *virtuous cycle* of data cleaning\n    -   Some people get a reputation for getting their data, analyses, etc. right\n    -   This is important for publications, grant funding, etc.\n    -   It tends to be inter-generational -- you inherit some of your reputation on this from your advisor\n    -   Start paying it forward now to build your own career, whether it's in academia or industry\n\n## How do I ensure data quality?\n\nThe [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-8fc1cb20fd15) website has a nice definition of EDA:\n\n> \"Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics\"\n\n-   So EDA is basically a fancy word for the descriptive statistics you've been learning about for years\n\n**I think about \"exploratory data analysis for data quality\"**\n\n-   Investigating values and patterns of variables from \"input data\"\n-   Identifying and cleaning errors or values that need to be changed\n-   Creating analysis variables\n-   Checking values of analysis variables against values of input variables\n\n## How I will teach exploratory data analysis\n\nWill teach exploratory data analysis (EDA) in two sub-sections:\n\n1.  Provide \"Guidelines for EDA\"\n    -   Less about coding, more about practices you should follow and mentality necessary to ensure high data quality\n2.  Introduce \"Tools of EDA\":\n    -   Demonstrate code to investigate variables and relationship between variables\n    -   Most of these tools are just the application of programming skills you have already learned (or will learn soon!)\n\n## Guidelines for \"EDA for data quality\"\n\nAssume that your goal in \"EDA for data quality\" is to investigate \"input\" data sources and create \"analysis variables\"\n\n-   Usually, your analysis dataset will incorporate multiple sources of input data, including data you collect (primary data) and/or data collected by others (secondary data)\n\nEDA is not a linear process, and the process will vary across people and projects Some broad steps:\n\n1.  Understand how input data sources were created\n    -   e.g., when working with survey data, have survey questionnaire and codebooks on hand (watch out for skip patterns!!!)\n2.  For each input data source, identify the \"unit of analysis\" and which combination of variables uniquely identify observations\n3.  Investigate patterns in input variables\n4.  Create analysis variable from input variable(s)\n5.  Verify that analysis variable is created correctly through descriptive statistics that compare values of input variable(s) against values of the analysis variable\n\n-   It is critically important to step through EDA processes at multiple points during data cleaning, from the input / raw data to the output / analysis / clean data.\n\n-   **Always be aware of missing values**\n\n-   They will not always be coded as `NA` in input variables (e.g., some projects code them as 99, 99999, negative values, etc.)\n\n## \"Unit of analysis\" and which variables uniquely identify observations\n\n\"Unit of analysis\" refers to \"what does each observation represent\" in an input data source\n\n-   If each obs represents a trial in an experiment, you have \"trial level data\"\n-   If each obs represents a participant, you have \"participant level data\"\n-   If each obs represents a sample, you have \"sample-level data\"\n-   If each obs represents a year, you have \"year level data\" (i.e. longitudinal)\n\nHow to identify unit of analysis\n\n-   data documentation\n\n-   investigating the data set\n\n-   This is very important because we often conduct analyses that span multiple units of analysis (e.g., between- v within-person, person- v stimuli-level, etc.)\n\n-   We have to be careful and thoughtful about identifiers that let us do that (important for joining data together, which will be the focus on our `R` workshop today)\n\n## Rules for creating new variables {.smaller}\n\nRules I follow for variable creation\n\n1.  Never modify \"input variable\"; instead create new variable based on input variable(s)\n    -   Always keep input variables used to create new variables\n2.  Investigate input variable(s) and relationship between input variables\n3.  Developing a plan for creation of analysis variable\n    -   e.g., for each possible value of input variables, what should value of analysis variable be?\n4.  Write code to create analysis variable\n5.  Run descriptive checks to verify new variables are constructed correctly\n    -   Can \"comment out\" these checks, but don't delete them\n6.  Document new variables with notes and labels\n\n# DESCRIPTIVES\n\n## Data we will use\n\nUse `read_csv()` function from `readr` (loaded with `tidyverse`) to import .csv dataset into `R`.\n\n```{r, results=\"hide\"}\nlibrary(plyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nsoep_long <- read_csv(file=\"https://github.com/emoriebeck/psc290-data-FQ23/raw/main/04-workshops/03-week3-tidyr/gsoep.csv\")\nsoep_long\n```\n\nLet's examine the data \\[you **must** run this code chunk\\]\n\n```{r, results=\"hide\"}\nsoep_long %>% names()\nsoep_long %>% names() %>% str()\n\nstr(soep_long) # ugh\n\nstr(soep_long$LifeEvent__Married)\nattributes(soep_long$LifeEvent__Married)\ntypeof(soep_long$LifeEvent__Married)\nclass(soep_long$LifeEvent__Married)\n```\n\n## Rule 1\n\n1.  Never modify \"input variable\"; instead create new variable based on input variable(s)\n    -   Always keep input variables used to create new variables\n\n-   I already did this before the data were loaded in. I renamed all the input variables with interpretable names and reshaped them so the time variable (year) is long and the other variables are wide\n\n## Rule 2 {.smaller}\n\n2.  Investigate input variable(s) and relationship between input variables\n\n-   We'll talk more about this in a bit when we discuss different kinds of descriptives, but briefly let's look at basic descriptives + zero-order correlations\n\n```{r}\ndescribe(soep_long)\n```\n\nThis doesn't look great because we've negative values where we shouldn't, which represent flags for different kinds of missing variables. We'll have to fix that\n\n-   I'll show you a better way later, but we haven't learned everything to do it nicely yet. So instead, we'll use `cor.plot()` from the `psych` package to make a simple heat map of the correlations.\n-   We shouldn't see that many negative correlations, which flags that we need to reverse score some items\n\n```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 12}\nsoep_2005 <- soep_long %>% filter(year == 2005) %>% select(-year)\ncor.plot(soep_2005, diag = F)\n```\n\n## Rule 3\n\n3.  Developing a plan for creation of analysis variable\n    -   e.g., for each possible value of input variables, what should value of analysis variable be?\n\n-   I do this in my codebooks, and this topic warrants a discussion in itself. This is our focal topic for next week!\n-   In this case, we want Big Five (EACNO) composites for each wave and to create composites of life events experienced across all years\n\n## Rule 4\n\n4.  Write code to create analysis variable\n\n-   From Rule 2, we know we need to recode missing values to NA and reverse code some items. From Rule 3, we know we need to create some composites.\n-   Let's do that now!\n\n### Recoding:\n\n```{r}\nsoep_long <- soep_long %>%\n  mutate_at(\n    vars(contains(\"Big5\"))\n    , ~ifelse(. < 0 | is.na(.), NA, .)\n    ) %>%\n  mutate_at(\n    vars(contains(\"LifeEvent\"))\n    , ~mapvalues(., seq(-7,1), c(rep(NA, 5), 0, NA, NA, 1), warn_missing = F)\n    )\n```\n\n### Reverse Coding:\n\n```{r}\nrev_code <- c(\"Big5__A_coarse\", \"Big5__C_lazy\", \"Big5__E_reserved\", \"Big5__N_dealStress\")\nsoep_long <- soep_long %>%\n  mutate_at(\n    vars(all_of(rev_code))\n    , ~as.numeric(reverse.code(., keys = -1, mini = 1, maxi = 7))\n    )\n```\n\nLet's check to make sure some correlations just reversed:\n\n```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 12}\nsoep_2005 <- soep_long %>% filter(year == 2005) %>% select(-year)\ncor.plot(soep_2005, diag = F)\n```\n\n### Create Composites:\n\n(Note: I honestly wouldn't normally do it like this, but we haven't learned how to reshape data yet! Check the online materials for code on how to do this)\n\n```{r}\nsoep_long <- soep_long %>% \n  group_by(year, Procedural__SID) %>%\n  rowwise() %>%\n  mutate(\n    Big5__E = mean(cbind(Big5__E_reserved, Big5__E_communic, Big5__E_sociable), na.rm = T),\n    Big5__A = mean(cbind(Big5__A_coarse, Big5__A_friendly, Big5__A_forgive), na.rm = T),\n    Big5__C = mean(cbind(Big5__C_thorough, Big5__C_efficient, Big5__C_lazy), na.rm = T),\n    Big5__N = mean(cbind(Big5__N_worry, Big5__N_nervous, Big5__N_dealStress), na.rm = T),\n    Big5__O = mean(cbind(Big5__O_original, Big5__O_artistic, Big5__O_imagin), na.rm = T)) %>%\n  group_by(Procedural__SID) %>%\n  mutate_at(\n    vars(contains(\"LifeEvent\"))\n    , lst(ever = ~max(., na.rm = T))\n    ) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  filter(year %in% c(2005, 2009, 2013))\n```\n\n```{r, echo = F}\nsoep_clean <- soep_long %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = contains(\"Big5\")\n    , names_to = c(\"trait\", \"item\")\n    , names_pattern = \"(.*)_(.*)\"\n    , values_to = \"value\"\n    , values_drop_na = T\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(Procedural__SID, Procedural__household, Demographic__DOB, \n           Demographic__Sex, year, trait) %>%\n  summarize(value = mean(value)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  full_join(\n    soep_long %>%\n      pivot_longer(\n        cols = contains(\"LifeEvent\")\n        , names_to = c(\"trait\")\n        , values_to = \"value\"\n        , values_drop_na = T\n      ) %>%\n      group_by(Procedural__SID, Procedural__household, Demographic__DOB, \n               Demographic__Sex, year, trait) %>%\n      summarize(value = max(value)) %>%\n      ungroup() \n  ) %>%\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = \"trait\"\n    , values_from = \"value\"\n  )\n```\n\n## Rule 5 {.smaller}\n\n5.  Run descriptive checks to verify new variables are constructed correctly\n    -   Can \"comment out\" these checks, but don't delete them\n\n```{r}\nsoep_long %>% \n  select(Big5__E:LifeEvent__SepPart_ever) %>%\n  describe()\n```\n\n-   Uh oh, `Inf` values popping up what went wrong?\n-   `-Inf` pops up when there were no non-missing values and you use `na.rm = T`\n-   Let's recode those as `NA`\n\n```{r}\nsoep_long <- soep_long %>%\n  mutate_all(~ifelse(is.infinite(.) | is.nan(.), NA, .))\n```\n\nAnd check out the descriptives again\n\n```{r}\nsoep_long %>% \n  select(Big5__E:LifeEvent__SepPart_ever) %>%\n  describe()\n```\n\n```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 12}\nsoep_long %>%\n  filter(year == 2005) %>%\n  select(Big5__E:LifeEvent__SepPart_ever) %>%\n  cor.plot(., diag = F)\n```\n\n## Rule 6\n\n6.  Document new variables with notes and labels\n\n-   Again, I do this in my codebooks, so more on this next week!!\n\n## EDA\n\n-   **One-way descriptive analyses** (i.e,. focus on one variable)\n    -

  `data`: the data, blank if piped\n    -   `cols`: columns to be made long, selected via `select()` calls\n    -   `names_to`: name(s) of key column(s) in new long data frame (string or string vector)\n    -   `values_to`: name of values in new long data frame (string)\n    -   `names_sep`: separator in column headers, if multiple keys\n    -   `values_drop_na`: drop missing cells (similar to `na.rm = T`) </font>\n\n### Basic Application\n\nLet's start with an easy one -- one key, one value:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\nbfi %>%\n  rownames_to_column(\"SID\") %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = A1:O5\n    , names_to = \"item\"\n    , values_to = \"values\"\n    , values_drop_na = T\n  ) %>%\n  print(n = 8)\n```\n\n### More Advanced Application\n\nNow a harder one -- two keys, one value:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\nbfi %>%\n  rownames_to_column(\"SID\") %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = A1:O5\n    , names_to = c(\"trait\", \"item_num\")\n    , names_sep = -1\n    , values_to = \"values\"\n    , values_drop_na = T\n  ) %>%\n  print(n = 8)\n```\n\n## 2. `pivot_wider()` {.smaller}\n\n-   (Formerly `spread()`) Makes wide data long, based on a key <font size=\"6\">\n-   Core arguments:\n    -

  `full_join()`\n    -   `inner_join()`\n    -   `left_join()`\n    -   `right_join()`\n\n-   Let's separate demographic and BFI data\n\n```{r, echo = T}\n#| code-line-numbers: \"|3\"\nbfi_only <- bfi %>% \n  rownames_to_column(\"SID\") %>%\n  select(SID, matches(\"[0-9]\"))\nbfi_only %>% as_tibble() %>% print(n = 6)\n```\n\n```{r, echo = T}\n#| code-line-numbers: \"|3\"\nbfi_dem <- bfi %>%\n  rownames_to_column(\"SID\") %>%\n  select(SID, education, gender, age)\nbfi_dem %>% as_tibble() %>% print(n = 6)\n```\n\nBefore we get into it, as a reminder, this is what the data set looks like before we do any joining:\n\n```{r, echo = T}\nbfi %>%\n  rownames_to_column(\"SID\") %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  print(n = 6)\n```\n\n## 3. `full_join()`\n\nMost simply, we can put those back together keeping all observations.\n\n```{r, echo = T}\nbfi_only %>%\n  full_join(bfi_dem) %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  print(n = 6)\n```\n\n## 4. `inner_join()`\n\nWe can also keep all rows present in *both* data frames\n\n```{r, echo = T}\n#| code-line-numbers: \"|1-2|4-5|3\"\nbfi_dem %>%\n  filter(row_number() %in% 1:1700) %>%\n  inner_join(\n    bfi_only %>%\n      filter(row_number() %in% 1200:2800)\n  ) %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  print(n = 6)\n```\n\n## 5. `left_join()`\n\nOr all rows present in the left (first) data frame, perhaps if it's a subset of people with complete data\n\n```{r, echo = T}\n#| code-line-numbers: \"|2|3\"\nbfi_dem %>%\n  drop_na() %>%\n  left_join(bfi_only) %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  print(n = 6)\n```\n\n## 6. `right_join()`\n\nOr all rows present in the right (second) data frame, such as I do when I join a codebook with raw data\n\n```{r, echo = T}\n#| code-line-numbers: \"|3\"\nbfi_dem %>%\n  drop_na() %>%\n  right_join(bfi_only) %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  print(n = 6)\n```\n\n## EDA\n\n-   **One-way descriptive analyses** (i.e,. focus on one variable)\n    -
