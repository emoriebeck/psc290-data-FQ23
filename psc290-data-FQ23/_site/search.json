    "text": "Course Description\n\n\n\nIn graduate education, training on research (and statistical) methods and conceptual frameworks far outpaces training on key technical skills that underpin all research, empirical or otherwise. On average, researchers spend about 80% of their (analytic) time on data cleaning, but we spend comparatively little teaching those skills. This course aims to fill that gap by helping researchers to (1) build their reproducible research workflow and (2) improve their data cleaning and general statistical programming skills. To that end, each session will be split to address each of these goals, with the beginning of class focused on conceptual ideas about best practices in building a workflow and the latter half focused on technical training on programming and cleaning data in R. This course will be set up as a “bring your own data” course to allow students to anticipate specific challenges that face different types of research. \nThis course is not a “pure” data science (i.e. we won’t be working with databases, etc.) because it focuses on the skills and tools most common within the social sciences. Science is a collaborative enterprise, and these tools are widely used among many social scientists, which promotes an open, equitable workflow by using tools available and most commonly used by the majority of our peers."

we can keep track of it\nAnd unlike a normal list, we aren’t stuck with nested list structures that are really hard to parse and navigate through\nNext, I’m going to show you how to use purrr with models\nModeling is not a focus of this class, but I want to demonstrate this as a workflow because it completely revolutionized mine!\nBut first, we need to format our data:\n\n\nCodedf_long <- df1 %>%\n  select(-satisfaction) %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(-count, -ID)\n    , names_to = c(\"trait\", \"item\")\n    , names_sep = \"_\"\n    , values_to = \"value\"\n    , values_drop_na = T\n    )\ndf_long\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nTo create composites, we’ll:\n1. separate traits from items 2. group_by() trait, count, and ID 3. calculate the composites using summarize()\n\nCodedf_long <- df_long %>%\n  group_by(ID, count, trait) %>%\n  summarize(value = mean(value)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  left_join(df1 %>% select(ID, count, satisfaction))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'ID', 'count'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\nJoining with `by = join_by(ID, count)`\n\nCodedf_long\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThen we’ll get within-person centered values using our own little function!\n\nCodecenter <- function(x) x - mean(x, na.rm = T)\n\ndf_long <- df_long %>%\n  group_by(ID, trait) %>%\n  mutate(value_c = center(value)) %>%\n  ungroup()\ndf_long\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAnd grand-mean centered within-person averages\n\nCodedf_long <- df_long %>%\n  group_by(ID, trait) %>%\n  mutate(value_gmc = mean(value)) %>%\n  group_by(trait) %>%\n  mutate(value_gmc = center(value_gmc)) %>%\n  ungroup()\ndf_long\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAnd now we are ready to run our models. But first, we’ll nest() our data.\n\nCodenested_mods <- df_long %>%\n  group_by(trait) %>%\n  nest() %>%\n  ungroup() \nnested_mods\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAnd now run the models.\n\nCoderun_model <- function(d) lmer(satisfaction ~ value_c * value_gmc + (1 | ID), data = d)\n\nnested_mods <- df_long %>%\n  group_by(trait) %>%\n  nest() %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(model = map(data, run_model))\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\n\nCodenested_mods\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAnd get data frames of the results:\n\nCodesprintfna <- function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), NA_character_, sprintf(\"%.2f\", x))\n\ntidy_tab <- function(m){\n  tidy(m, conf.int = T) %>%\n    mutate(pval = pnorm(abs(estimate/`std.error`), lower.tail = FALSE),\n           p = round(pval, digits = 3),\n           p = ifelse(pval < .001, \"p &lt; .001\", paste0(\"p = \", p))) %>%\n    mutate_at(vars(estimate, conf.low, conf.high), sprintfna) %>%\n    mutate(CI = ifelse(is.na(conf.low), \"\", sprintf(\"[%s,%s]\", conf.low, conf.high))) %>%\n    dplyr::select(term, estimate, CI, p)\n}\n\nnested_mods <- nested_mods %>%\n  mutate(tidy = map(model, tidy_tab))\nnested_mods\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nUnnesting\nWhich we can print into pretty data frames\n\nCodenested_mods %>%\n  select(trait, tidy) %>%\n  unnest(tidy)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nUnnesting & Tabling\nWhich we can pretty easily turn into tables:\n\nCodemod_tab <- nested_mods %>%\n  select(trait, tidy) %>%\n  unnest(tidy) %>%\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = \"trait\"\n    , names_glue = \"{trait}_{.value}\"\n    , values_from = c(\"estimate\", \"CI\", \"p\")\n  ) %>%\n  select(term, starts_with(\"E\"), starts_with(\"A\"), starts_with(\"C\"), starts_with(\"N\"), starts_with(\"O\"))\n\nmod_tab\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nCodehdr <- c(1, rep(3, 5))\nnames(hdr) <- c(\" \", \"Extraversion\", \"Agreeableness\", \"Conscientiousness\", \"Neuroticism\", \"Openness\")\n\nmod_tab <- mod_tab %>%\n  kable(.\n        , \"html\"\n        , escape = F\n        , col.names = c(\"Term\", rep(c(\"<em>b</em>\", \"CI\", \"<em>p</em>\"), times = 5))\n        , align = c(\"r\", rep(\"c\", 15))\n        , caption = \"<strong>Table 1</strong><br><em>Multilevel Model Estimates of Between- and Within-Person Big Five-State Satisfaction Associations\"\n        ) %>%\n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Times\", font_size = 15) %>%\n  add_header_above(hdr)\nmod_tab\n\n\n\n\nTable 1Multilevel Model Estimates of Between- and Within-Person Big Five-State Satisfaction Associations\n\n \n\n\nExtraversion\nAgreeableness\nConscientiousness\nNeuroticism\nOpenness\n\n\n Term \n    b \n    CI \n    p \n    b \n    CI \n    p \n    b \n    CI \n    p \n    b \n    CI \n    p \n    b \n    CI \n    p \n  \n\n\n\n (Intercept) \n    2.98 \n    [2.93,3.03] \n    p < .001 \n    2.98 \n    [2.93,3.03] \n    p < .001 \n    2.97 \n    [2.92,3.02] \n    p < .001 \n    2.99 \n    [2.94,3.03] \n    p < .001 \n    2.97 \n    [2.93,3.02] \n    p < .001 \n  \n\n value_c \n    -0.07 \n    [-0.14,0.00] \n    p = 0.029 \n    -0.02 \n    [-0.10,0.05] \n    p = 0.279 \n    0.03 \n    [-0.05,0.10] \n    p = 0.231 \n    -0.01 \n    [-0.08,0.06] \n    p = 0.378 \n    0.02 \n    [-0.05,0.09] \n    p = 0.29 \n  \n\n value_gmc \n    0.17 \n    [0.03,0.32] \n    p = 0.008 \n    0.13 \n    [-0.05,0.31] \n    p = 0.081 \n    0.19 \n    [0.06,0.32] \n    p = 0.003 \n    -0.09 \n    [-0.19,0.01] \n    p = 0.032 \n    0.14 \n    [-0.04,0.33] \n    p = 0.067 \n  \n\n value_c:value_gmc \n    0.02 \n    [-0.17,0.22] \n    p = 0.399 \n    0.16 \n    [-0.12,0.44] \n    p = 0.127 \n    0.15 \n    [-0.04,0.34] \n    p = 0.061 \n    -0.19 \n    [-0.34,-0.03] \n    p = 0.009 \n    0.25 \n    [0.01,0.49] \n    p = 0.019 \n  \n\n sd__(Intercept) \n    0.00 \n     \n     \n    0.04 \n     \n     \n    0.00 \n     \n     \n    0.00 \n     \n     \n    0.03 \n     \n     \n  \n\n sd__Observation \n    1.16 \n     \n     \n    1.15 \n     \n     \n    1.17 \n     \n     \n    1.15 \n     \n     \n    1.16"

For example:\n\n\n\\d is used to match any digit (i.e., number)\n\n\\s is used to match any whitespace (i.e., space, tab, or newline character)\n\n\\w is used to match any word character (i.e., alphanumeric character or underscore)\n\n\n“But wait… there’s more!

I try to write it so that it can be used across multiple qualitatively different models if I’m running different (e.g., see second example later). To do that, I have (1) the function and (2) a tibble called terms that contains the paths I want to extract.\n\nCodeterms <- tribble(\n  ~path,     ~new,\n  \"i~1\", \"Intercept\",\n  \"s~1\", \"Slope\",\n  \"i~~i\", \"Intercept Variance\",\n  \"s~~s\", \"Slope Variance\",\n  \"i~~s\", \"Intercept-Slope Covariance\"\n)\n\nextract_fun <- function(m){\n  parameterEstimates(m) %>%\n    data.frame() %>%\n    unite(path, lhs, op, rhs, sep = \"\") %>%\n    filter(path %in% terms$path) %>%\n    left_join(terms) %>%\n    select(term = new, est, se, ci.lower, ci.upper, pvalue)\n}\n\n\nNow we can run that function to extract the results we care about\n\nCodegsoep_nested2 <- gsoep_nested2 %>%\n  mutate(summary = map(m, extract_fun))\ngsoep_nested2"

    "text": "Plot the Predictions\nOne of the greatest strengths of list-columns and using purrr is what I think of as the data accordion. With list-columns, I can unnest() whatever level the models were estimated at and then reaggregate using whatever combinations / groups make the most sense.\nSo here, for example, we ran models for all Big Five trait (5) x life outcome (10) combinations. But having 50 separate plots would be a little silly, so we’d much rather create one for each outcome. But I’m not going to write that code 10 times because that’d be a waste. So instead if I reaggregate the data, I can then use a function + purrr to generate each of the plots.\n\nCodegsoep_plot4 <- gsoep_nested4 %>%\n  select(-data, -m) %>%\n  unnest(pred) %>%\n  group_by(Outcome) %>%\n  nest() %>%\n  ungroup()\ngsoep_plot4\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhen we write code for plots in ggplot, we have a lot of things that we end up writing over and over, especially for theme elements. To get around this, I use this little function to modify all of my theme elements in a single line.\n\nCodemy_theme <- function(){\n  theme_classic() + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n    , legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = rel(1))\n    , legend.text = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = rel(1))\n    , axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = rel(1.1), color = \"black\")\n    , axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = rel(1.2))\n    , panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey90\", linewidth = .2)\n    , plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = rel(1.2), hjust = .5)\n    , plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = rel(1.2), hjust = .5)\n    , strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = rel(1.1), color = \"white\")\n    , strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\")\n    )\n}\n\n\nLike I mentioned, once we reaggregate the data, we can then write a function to generate the plot for each outcome separately. Let’s start by building the basic code for the plot. We need it to: 1. Have x = personality, y = predicted values, separate lines for moderator levels, and separate panels for different traits 2. A line indicating personality-outcome associations (again separately across age groups) and a ribbon with the confidence interval around the prediction\n\nCodeplot_fun <- function(d){\n  d %>%\n    mutate(age_fac = factor(age, c(-15, 0, 15), c(\"30\", \"45\", \"60\"))) %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = p_value, y = fit, color = age_fac)) +\n    geom_ribbon(\n      aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper, fill = age_fac)\n      , alpha = .4\n    ) + \n    geom_line() + \n    facet_wrap(~Trait, scales = \"free_x\") + \n    my_theme()\n}\n\n\nWith our reaggregated data, we can easily just run the plots and view the results.

She received her PhD in Social and Personality Psychology from Washington University in St. Louis in 2020 and her BA (with honors) from Brown University in 2016. \nDr. Beck’s research focuses around the question of what personality is. Definitions have big consequences for how we measure personality, what those measures predict both short- and long-term, how personality is thought to change, and more. One way of doing this is to focus on different levels of aggregation. Thus, she studies how to understand the personality of an individual relative to only themself, relative to some others, and relative to all others. To do so, she uses a mix of methods, including experience sampling methods, passive sensing, survey data, panel data, cognitive tests, and more measured across time intervals from moments to years along with an array of statistical approaches, including time series analysis, multilevel / hierarchical modeling, machine learning, network psychometrics, structural equation modeling, and more. For example, Dr. Beck has been working to build personalized machine learning prediction of behaviors, experiences, and more, finding that we can predict behaviors and experiences better when we don’t assume that people have the same antecedents of the behaviors and experiences.  Instead, people have unique antecedents, which could have consequences for how to change or intervene upon behaviors and experiences. In other work, Dr. Beck uses longitudinal panel data across multiple continents to answer questions about what personality traits predict over time. For example, she recently examined personality trait and well-being predictors of later dementia diagnoses and neuropathology measures after death, finding that personality traits are strong predictors of dementia diagnosis but have a much more complex relationship with neuropathology measures."

It is where the program will read and write files by default. You have only one working directory at a time.\nThe terms ‘working directory’, ‘current working directory’ and ‘current directory’ all mean the same thing.\n\nFind your current working directory with:\n\nCodegetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/emoriebeck/Documents/teaching/PSC290-cleaning-fall-2023/psc290-data-FQ23/psc290-data-FQ23\"\n\n\nRelative paths\nA relative path gives the location of a filesystem object relative to the working directory, (i.e., that returned by getwd()).\n\nWhen pigeon.txt is in the working directory the relative path is just the file * name: pigeon.txt\nIf there is a folder in the working directory called data-raw and pigeon.txt is in there then the relative path is data-raw/pigeon.txt\nPaths: moving up the hierarchy\n\n../ allows you to look in the directory above the working directory\nWhen pigeon.txt is in folder above the working the relative path is ../pigeon.txt\nAnd if it is in a folder called data-raw which is in the directory above the working directory then the relative path is ../data-raw/pigeon.txt\nWhat’s in my directory?\nYou can list the contents of a directory using the dir() command\n\n\ndir() list the contents of the working directory\n\ndir(\"..\") list the contents of the directory above the working directory\n\ndir(\"../..\") list the contents of the directory two directories above the working directory\n\ndir(\"data-raw\") list the contents of a folder call data-raw which is in the working directory.\nRelative or absolute\n\nMost of the time you should use relative paths because that makes your work portable (i.e. to a different machine / user / etc.).\n🎉 The tab key is your friend!\nYou only need to use absolute paths when you are referring to filesystem outside the one you are using.\n\nI often store the beginning of that path as object.\n\nweb_wd <- “https://github.com/emoriebeck/pigeons/”\nThen I can use sprintf() or paste() to add different endings\n\n\n\n\nCodeweb_wd <- \"https://github.com/emoriebeck/pigeons/\"\nsprintf(\"%s/data-raw/pigeon.txt\", web_wd)\n\n[1] \"https://github.com/emoriebeck/pigeons//data-raw/pigeon.txt\""

We will use RStudio to interface with R console for a more user-friendly experience.\nPlease install both R and RStudio before the first day of class. Here’s how:\n\nGet the most recent version of R (free). Download the version of R compatible with your operating system (Mac, Linux, or Windows). If you are running Windows or MacOS, you should choose one of the precompiled binary distributions (i.e., ready-to-run applications; .exe for windows or .pkg for Mac) linked at the top of the R Project’s webpage.\nOnce R is installed, download and install R Studio (soon to be Pivot). R Studio is an “Integrated Development Environment”, or IDE. This means it is a front-end for R that makes it much easier to work with. R Studio is also free, and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.\nInstall the tidyverse library and several other add-on packages for R.

Therefore, to get the most out of this class, I highly recommend having a better-than-beginner understanding or and experience with the R programming language. R is a skill, just like understanding the components of quality data and workflows, and for the purposes of this course, both are equally necessary and important.

Rather, the goal is to teach you principles of good, accurate, reproducible, and efficient data cleaning and management, how to identify features of high quality data, and how to produce results of analyses efficiently.\nWeekly homework (40%) in this class will focus on programming concepts from that week. Each week, you will complete one problem set, applying the skills you learned that week to your own data. Submit each of these via Canvas by midnight the Sunday before class.\nThese will be graded for completion (you turned it in), relevance (it should be clear that you actually tried to do what you asked), and effort (please show your work). You will not receive feedback on them unless there is an ongoing problem (e.g., lack of depth or effort).\nThis is good opportunity to:\n\nBetter understand challenges with your own data (relative to others)\nReflect on features of your current workflow you like or dislike\nCritique your own work and note ideas to improve (I will probably do this a lot in class!).\nCreate a repository of ideas and code for future research.\n\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThe final exam for this course is instead a final project, due at the day and time of the scheduled final exam. The last day of the course will (likely) be used for presentations on the final project in order to receive feedback from the class and instructor.\nAdditional information on the project will be provided as a separate document on Canvas, announced in week 4 or 5. The project will not be long and the goal will be for you create a document outlining your workflow.\nTo ensure that your workflows are as effective as possible, this will proceed in three parts:\n\nInitial proposal of an idea submitted via Canvas.\nUpdated proposal submitted via Canvas.\n5-10 minute presentation to the class on the last day of the course (10% of your grade).\n\nFinal Project (20%).\n\n\nExtra Credit\n\nParticipate in a https://www.tidytuesday.com.\n2 pt extra credit for each one you participate in (max 6 pt total).\nCan post on Twitter or just create a document with the code and output\nSubmit on Canvas\n\nIf posting, link the post in in your submission\nIf not posting, attach the knitted file\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation and Grading Scale\nAll grades will be posted on Canvas.

    "text": "Course Policies and Procedures\nMany of the below are also outlined in the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct.\n\nAttendance Policy\nWhen you miss class, you miss important information, not all of which will be available in the zoom recordings. This course is only 10 class meetings, so each meeting comprises 10% of your in-class time. If you need to miss more than one class, I suggest considering whether taking this course in a future term. I will teach this course either annually or biennially, so there will be future opportunities to take this course in many cases (e.g., for example, if you are a second year student who will miss two meetings, taking the course in your fourth year may be more effective).\n\n\nLate Work/Make-up Policy\nLate work will be allowed per instructor discretion. Please try to proactively communicate these needs. Assignments due at midnight will have a 9 hour “grace period” with no penalty. Each day late is subject to a 20% drop in course grade (e.g., a 10-point response is worth 8 points on day 1 late, 6 points on day 2 late, etc.).\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nYou are expected to practice the highest possible standards of academic integrity. Any deviation from this expectation will result in a minimum academic penalty of your failing the assignment, and will result in additional disciplinary measures. This includes improper citation of sources, using another student’s work, and any other form of academic misrepresentation.\n\nPlagiarism\nUsing the words or ideas of another as if they were one’s own is a serious form of academic dishonesty. If another person’s complete sentence, syntax, key words, or the specific or unique ideas and information are used, one must give that person credit through proper citation.\n\n\n\nIncomplete Grades\nYou may assigned an ‘I’ (Incomplete) grade if you are unable to complete some portion of the assigned course work because of an unanticipated illness, accident, work-related responsibility, family hardship, or verified learning disability. An Incomplete grade is not intended to give you additional time to complete course assignments or extra credit unless there is indication that the specified circumstances prevented you from completing course assignments on time.\n\n\nInstructional Methods\nThe course will be taught using multiple instructional methods. I will typically briefly (45-50 minutes) lecture at the beginning of the class on conceptual topics related to data cleaning and management. We will then have a 75 minute workshop, which will be a mix of going through code and examples together and working in small groups (if preferred) on short exercises. The remainder of the class will be available to receive support on Problem Sets for that week and other general questions (optional). The proportion of these will vary by week and portions of the course will be shortened or dropped as needed.\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nThe university is committed to a campus environment that is inclusive, safe, and respectful for all persons. To that end, all course activities will be conducted in an atmosphere of friendly participation and interaction among colleagues, recognizing and appreciating the unique experiences, background, and point of view each student brings. You are expected at all times to apply the highest academic standards to this course and to treat others with dignity and respect.\n\nAccessibility, Disability, and Triggers [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz]\nI am committed to ensuring course accessibility for all students. If you have a documented disability and expect reasonable accommodation to complete course requirements, please notify me at least one week before accommodation is needed. Please also provide SDRC (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/) documentation to me before requesting accommodation. Likewise, if you are aware of cognitive or emotional triggers that could disrupt your intellectual or mental health, please let me know so that I can be aware in terms of course content. \nAbsences for Personal or Religious Holidays\nI am committed to allowing students to exercise their rights to religious freedom. Accommodations on assignment due dates and absences will be allowed for students observing religious holidays that fall on course days. Please email me to let me know ahead of time to allow for accommodations to be made.\n\n\nTitle IX and Gendered Pronouns [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz]\nThis course affirms equality and respect for all gendered identities and expressions. Please don’t hesitate to correct me regarding your preferred gender pronoun and/or name if different from what is indicated on the official class roster. Likewise, I am committed to nurturing an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Consistent with Title IX policy, please be aware that I as a responsible employee am obligated to report information that you provide to me about a situation involving sexual harassment or assault. \n\n\nValues [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz]\nTwo core values, inquiry and civility, govern our class. Inquiry demands that we all cultivate an open forum for exchange and substantiation of ideas. Strive to be creative, to take risks, and to challenge our conventional wisdom when you see the opportunity. Civility supports our inquiry by demanding ultimate respect for the voice, rights, and safety of others. Threatening or disruptive conduct may result in course and/or university dismissal. Civility also presumes basic courtesy: please be well rested, on time, and prepared for class (class time also includes a break to use the restroom, etc.), which includes silencing all personal devices. \nMy perspective is that we never cease being students of this world, so I believe that attentive, reflective people always have something to learn from others. Good discussions can be energetic and passionate but are neither abusive nor offensive. Vibrant, vigorous inquiry derives from discussions that:\n\nchallenge, defend, and apply different ideas, theories, perspectives, and skills,\nextend a body of knowledge into different arenas and applications, and\nresult in a synergy that compels us to seek resolution to these discussions.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright/Fair Use\nI will cite and/or reference any materials that I use in this course that I do not create.  You, as students, are expected to not distribute any of these materials, resources, homework assignments, etc. (whether graded or ungraded) without permission from the instructor."

    "text": "Codebooks\n\nFor me, codebooks are the most essential and important part of any research project\nCodebooks allow me to:\n\nparse through documentation and find all the variables I want\ndocument detailed information about each of those variables\nmake cleaning and compositing choices for each (e.g., renaming, recoding, removing missings, etc.)\ndifferentiate among the kind of variables I have (e.g., predictors, outcomes, covariates, manipulations, and other categories)\nPass all this information into R to aid in data cleaning\n\n\n\nExample Codebook\nIn this case, we are going to using some data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (GSOEP), which is an ongoing Panel Study in Germany. Note that these data are for teaching purposes only, shared under the license for the Comprehensive SOEP teaching dataset, which I, as a contracted SOEP user, can use for teaching purposes. These data represent select cases from the full data set and should not be used for the purpose of publication. The full data are available for free at https://www.diw.de/en/diw_02.c.222829.en/access_and_ordering.html.\nFor this tutorial, I created the codebook for you: Download, and included what I believe are the core columns you may need. Some of these columns may not be particularly helpful for every dataset.\nMy Core Codebook Columns\nHere are my core columns that are based on the original data:\n\n\n\ndataset name (dataset)\n\nhow I categorize the variables (category)\n\nhow I rename each item (item)\n\nhow I composite the variables (name)\n\noriginal variable name (old_name)\n\noriginal item text (item_text)\n\noriginal item values (scale)\n\n\n\n\nhow I will recode each item (in text; recode_desc)\n\nhow I will recode each item (in R; recode)\n\nwhether item is reverse coded (reverse)\n\nscale minimum (mini)\n\nscale maximum (maxi)\n\ntimeline of variable collection (year or wave)\n\nmeta name / never changing name (meta)\n\n\n\n\n\ndataset: this column indexes the name of the dataset that you will be pulling the data from. This is important because we will use this info later on (see purrr tutorial) to load and clean specific data files. Even if you don’t have multiple data sets, I believe consistency is more important and suggest using this.\ncategory: broad categories that different variables can be put into. I’m a fan of naming them things like “outcome”, “predictor”, “moderator”, “demographic”, “procedural”, etc. but sometimes use more descriptive labels like “Big 5” to indicate the model from which the measures are derived.\nname: label is basically one level lower than category. So if the category is Big 5, the label would be, or example, “A” for Agreeableness, “SWB” for subjective well-being, etc. This column is most important and useful when you have multiple items in a scales, so I’ll typically leave this blank when something is a standalone variable (e.g. sex, single-item scales, etc.).\nitem_name: This is the lowest level and most descriptive variable. It indicates which item in scale something is. So it may be “kind” for Agreebleness or “sex” for the demographic biological sex variable.\nold_name: this column is the name of the variable in the data you are pulling it from. This should be exact. The goal of this column is that it will allow us to select() variables from the original data file and rename them something that is more useful to us.\nitem_text: this column is the original text that participants saw or a description of the item.\nscale: this column tells you what the scale of the variable is. Is it a numeric variable, a text variable, etc. This is helpful for knowing the plausible range.\nrecode_text: sometimes, we want to recode variables for analyses (e.g. for categorical variables with many levels where sample sizes for some levels are too small to actually do anything with it). I use this column to note the kind of recoding I’ll do to a variable for transparency.\nrecode: I write the R code I’ll parse by reading my codebook into R into this column.\n\nHere are additional columns that will make our lives easier or are applicable to some but not all data sets:\n\n\nreverse: this column tells you whether items in a scale need to be reverse coded. I recommend coding this as 1 (leave alone) and -1 (reverse) for reasons that will become clear later.\n\n\nmini: this column represents the minimum value of scales that are numeric. Leave blank otherwise.\n\n\nmaxi: this column represents the maximum value of scales that are numeric. Leave blank otherwise.\n\n\nyear: for longitudinal data, we have several waves of data and the name of the same item across waves is often different, so it’s important to note to which wave an item belongs. You can do this by noting the wave (e.g. 1, 2, 3), but I prefer the actual year the data were collected (e.g. 2005, 2009, etc.)\n\n\nmeta: Some datasets have a meta name, which essentially means a name that variable has across all waves to make it clear which variables are the same. They are not always useful as some data sets have meta names but no great way of extracting variables using them. But they’re still typically useful to include in your codebook regardless."

Differences within categories are generally captured via columns in my codebook\n\nRename Variables\nChange Data to Long\n\nTo get our codebook to play nice with the data since our data are in wide form (including across years), we need to make the data long with at least one name that corresponds to the codebook\nIn this case, we’ll all the variables but the participant and household ID’s long, and change the item name to old_name since it contains the original variable names.\n\n\nCode## change data to long format\nsoep_long <- soep %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(-persnr, -hhnr)\n    , names_to = \"old_name\"\n    , values_to = \"value\"\n    , values_drop_na = T\n  ) %>%\n  rename(SID = persnr, HHID = hhnr)\nsoep_long\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nMerge in Codebook\n\nNow, let’s actually merge in the codebook.

How will it change your workflow, etc. There is no minimum of maximum length, but my guess is 1-2 paragraphs.\n5 points\n\n\nApproach: Short description of how you went about creating your product. Describe what tools you used, how you went about creating the product (e.g., built a shell and then built the rest out from there). There is no minimum of maximum length, but my guess is no less than 2-3 paragraphs.\n10 points\n\n\nReflection: Reflect on what you learned in this project / class. What course concepts did you draw on? What barriers did you have to overcome to complete the project? If you were to start over, would you do it the same way again or take a different strategy? These are just some examples of questions to consider in reflecting on your project. There is no minimum of maximum length, but my guess is 2-3 paragraphs.\n5 points\n\n\nTotal\n25 points"

I recommend choosing something you’ve been wanting to do but haven’t had time to prioritize and using this as an excuse to do so.\nAs mentioned above, this could be anything from finishing up cleaning some gnarly data you’ve had for awhile, redoing your documentation for a study that’s already been collected (or you plan to collect), building templates or procedures, etc. What I want from you for this project is something that is: * Useful to you, both short- and long-term * Challenging but doable (you’re better at this than you think!) * Something you feel proud of"
