-   If you need to miss 2+ classes (i.e. 20+% of total class time), maybe consider taking the course in a different year

### Problem Sets

-   The main homework in the course are weekly problem sets
-   The goal is to let you apply concepts from that week to your own data (or whatever data you'll focus on for the class)
-   Problem sets will be posted on Mondays before class
-   Due 12:01 AM each Monday (starting next Monday and not including the last day of the course)

### Final Projects

-   Final project replaces final exam (there are no exams)
-   This is a bring your own data class, so the goal of the course is to apply what you're learning to your own research throughout the term
-   Details of the final project TBD, but will generally include
    -   Stage 1: Proposals (due 11/13/23)
    -   Stage 2: In-class presentations (12/04/23)
    -   Stage 3: Final project submission (Due day and time of scheduled final; which I can't access because ScheduleBuilder thinks I need a CRN for my own course and no one emails me back 🙃)

### Extra Credit

-   Participate in a <https://www.tidytuesday.com>.

-   2 pt extra credit for each one you participate in (max 6 pt total).

# What is a workflow?

-   Dictionary definition: "the sequence of industrial, administrative, or other processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion"
-   Research Workflow: "The process of conducting research from conceptualization to dissemination"

## Why Should I Care?

-   Whether you like it or not, you have a workflow
-   You have ways you go about doing a project that you maybe haven't thought too much about
-   Issues arise when
    1.  A workflow has *missing steps*
    2.  Your workflow is *inconsistent* across projects
    3.  Your workflow is *inefficient*, which can lead to mistakes
-   A workflow is a work in progress. If it no longer serves you, let it go

## How Do I Build a Workflow?

-   Building a good workflow is both top-down (i.e. big steps to smaller ones) and bottom-up (i.e. necessary smaller steps make certain larger ones necessary)

## Workflows: Overview of the Course

In this class, we will focus on building tools for:

-   Documenting Data (both before and after collection)\

-   File management (how do I build a machine and human navigable directory)\

-   Loading data files\

-   All steps of cleaning data\

-   Restructuring Data\

-   DESCRIPTIVES DESCRIPTIVES DESCRIPTIVES\

-   Efficient Programming (plz stop copy-pasting)

-   This class does not focus on modeling but rather how you get your data set up to run models (Weeks 1-5/6) AND how to extract and present data after you run them (Weeks 6/7-9)

-   We will focus on classes of models in R you will most likely encounter (`lm()`, `glm()`, `lmer()`, `nlme()`, `lavaan`, `brms`)

-   If you run other kinds of models, most tools we will use are portable to many packages and other object classes

-   By the end of this class, my goal is that you:\

1.  Have a documented workflow for the kind of research you work on\
2.  Have a set of tools and skills that apply to each piece of that workflow\
3.  Have a skillset that will allow you to adapt and build new workflows for different kinds of research

# Fundamentals of R

## What is R? Why R?

-   An "open source" programming language and software that provide collections of interrelated "functions"
-   "open source" means that *R* is free and created by the user community. The user community can modify basic things about *R* and add new capabilities to what R can do the user community can modify R and
-   a "function" is usually something that takes in some "input," processes this input in some way, and creates some "output"
    -   e.g., the `max()` function takes as input a collection of numbers (e.g., 3,5,6) and returns as output the number with the maximum value
    -   e.g., the `lm()` function takes in as inputs a dataset and a statistical model you specify within the function, and returns as output the results of the regression model

## Base R vs. R packages

::: columns
::: column
Base R

-   When you install R, you automatically install the ["Base R"](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html) set of functions
-   Example of a few of the functions in in Base R:
    -   `as.character()` function
    -   `print()` function
    -   `setwd()` function
:::

::: column
R packages

-   an R "package" (or "library") is a collection of (related) functions developed by the R community
-   Examples of R packages:
    -   `tidyverse` package for manipulating and visualizing data
    -   `igraph` package for network analyses
    -   `leaflet` package for mapping
    -   `rvest` package for webscraping
    -   `rtweet` package for streaming and downloading data from Twitter
-   **All** R packages are free!

## Why Use RStudio (Pivot)

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Also free
-   Basically a GUI for R
-   Organize files, import data, etc. with ease
-   RMarkdown, Quarto, and more are powerful tools (they were used to create these slides!)
-   Lots of new features and support

## Why Use the `tidyverse`

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Maintained by RStudio (Pivot)
-   No one should have to use a for loop to change data from long to wide
-   Tons of integrated tools for data cleaning, manipulation, transformation, and visualization
-   Even increasing support for modeling (e.g., `tidymodels`)

## Why use Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

![](https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/raw/main/thumbs/quarto.png){fig-align="center"}

-   These slides\
-   The course website\
-   Your homework\
-   All written in Quarto

## Some R Basics

### Executing R commands

Three ways to execute commands in R

1.  Type/copy commands directly into the "console"
2.  \`code chunks' in RMarkdown (.Rmd files)
    -   **Cmd/Ctrl + Enter**: execute highlighted line(s) within chunk
    -   **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + k**: "knit" entire document
3.  R scripts (.R files)
    -   **Cmd/Ctrl + Enter**: execute highlighted line(s)
    -   **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter** (without highlighting any lines): run entire script

### Assignment

**Assignment** refers to creating an "object" and assigning values to it

-   The object may be a variable, a dataset, a bit of text that reads "la la la"
-   `<-` is the assignment operator
    -   in other languages `=` is the assignment operator
-   general syntax:
    -   `object_name <- object_values`
    -   good practice to put a space before and after assignment operator

### Objects

R is an "object-oriented" programming language (like Python, JavaScript). So, what is an "object"?

-   formal computer science definitions are confusing because they require knowledge of concepts we haven't introduced yet
-   More intuitively, I think objects as anything I assign values to
    -   For example, below, `a` and `b` are the names of objects I assigned values to

```{r, echo = T}
a <- 5
a
b <- "yay!"
b
```

-   [Ben Skinner](https://www.btskinner.io) says "Objects are like boxes in which we can put things: data, functions, and even other objects."

-   Many commercial statistical software packages (e.g., SPSS, Stata) operate on datasets, which consist of rows of observations and columns of variables

-   Usually, these packages can open only one dataset at a time

-   By contrast, in R everything is an object and there is no limit to the number of objects R can hold (except memory)

### Vectors

The fundamental data structure in R is the "vector"

-   A vector is a collection of values

-   The individual values within a vector are called "elements"

-   Values in a vector can be numeric, character (e.g., "Apple"), or some other *type*

-   Below we use the combine function `c()` to create a numeric vector that contains three elements

-   Help file says that `c()` "combines values into a vector or list"

```{r, echo = T}
#?c # to see help file for the c() "combine" function
x <- c(4, 7, 9) # create object called x, which is a vector with three elements 
# (each an integer)
x # print object x
```

Vector where the elements are characters

```{r, echo = T}
animals <- c("lions", "tigers", "bears", "oh my") # create object called animals
animals
```

## EXERCISE

Either in the R console or within the R markdown file, do the following:

1.  Create a vector called `v1` with three elements, where all the elements are numbers. Then print the values.
2.  Create a vector called `v2` with four elements, where all the elements are characters (i.e., enclosed in single '' or double "" quotes). Then print the values.
3.  Create a vector called `v3` with five elements, where some elements are numeric and some elements are characters. Then print the values.

## Solution to Exercise

```{r, echo = T}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3) 
# create a vector called v1 with three elements
# all the elements are numbers
v1 # print value
```

```{r, echo = T}
v2 <- c("a", "b", "c", "d") 
# create a vector called v2 with four elements
# all the elements are characters
v2 # print value
```

```{r, echo = T}
v3 <- c(1, 2, 3, "a", "b") 
# create a vector called v3 with five element
# some elements are numeric and some elements are characters
v3 # print value
```

## Formal classification of vectors in R

-   Here, I introduce the classification of vectors by Grolemund and Wickham

-   There are two broad types of vectors

1.  **Atomic vectors**. An object that contains elements. Six "types" of atomic vectors:
    -   **logical**, **integer**, **double**, **character**, **complex**, and **raw**.
        -   **Integer** and **double** vectors are collectively known as **numeric** vectors.
2.  **Lists**. Like atomic vectors, lists are objects that contain elements
    -   elements within a list may be atomic vectors
    -   elements within a list may also be other lists; that is lists can contain other lists

One difference between atomic vectors and lists: **homogeneous** vs. **heterogeneous** elements

-   atomic vectors are **homogeneous**: all elements within atomic vector must be of the same type
-   lists can be **heterogeneous**: e.g., one element can be an integer and another element can be character

Problem with this classification:

-   Not conceptually intutive
-   Technically, lists are a type of vector, but people often think of atomic vectors and lists as fundamentally different things

**Classification used by Ben Skinner**:

-   data **type**: logical, numeric (integer and double), character, etc.
-   data **structure**: vector, list, matrix, etc.

## Using R functions

### What are functions

-   **Functions** are pre-written bits of code that accomplish some task.

-   Functions generally follow three sequential steps:

1.  take in an **input** object(s)
2.  **process** the input.
3.  **return** (A) a new object or (B) a visualizatoin (e.g., plot)

-   For example, `sum()` function calculates sum of elements in a vector

1.  **input**. takes in a vector of elements (numeric or logical)
2.  **processing**. Calculates the sum of elements
3.  **return**. Returns numeric vector of length=1; value is sum of input vector

```{r, echo = T}
sum(c(1,2,3))
typeof(sum(c(1,2,3))) # type of object created by sum()
length(sum(c(1,2,3))) # length of object created by sum()
```

### Function syntax

Components of a function

-   function name (e.g., `sum()`, `length()`, `seq()`)
-   function arguments
    -   Inputs that the function takes, which determine what function does
        -   can be vectors, data frames, logical statements, etc.
    -   In "function call" you specify values to assign to these function arguments
        -   e.g., `sum(c(1,2,3))`
    -   Separate arguments with a comma `,`
        -   e.g., `seq(10,15)`
-   Example: the sequence function, `seq()`

```{r, echo = T}
seq(10,15)
```

### Function syntax: More on function arguments

Usually, function arguments have names

-   e.g., the `seq()` function includes the arguments `from`, `to`, `by`
-   when you call the function, you need to assign values to these arguments; but you usually don't have to specify the name of the argument

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
seq(from=10, to=20, by=2)
seq(10,20,2)
```
:::

Many function arguments have "default values", set by whoever wrote the function

-   if you don't specify a value for that argument, the default value is inserted
-   e.g., partial list of default values for `seq()`: `seq(from=1, to=1, by=1)`

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
seq()
seq(to=10)
seq(10) # R assigned value of 10 to "to" rather than "from" or "by"
```
:::

### Help files for functions

::: columns
::: column
To see help file on a function, type `?function_name` without parentheses

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = T}
?sum
?seq
```
:::

::: column
**Contents of help files**

-   **Description**. What the function does
-   **Usage**. Syntax, including default values for arguments
-   **Arguments**. Description of function arguments
-   **Details**. Details and idiosyncracies of about how the function works.
-   **Value**. What (object) the function "returns"
    -   e.g., `sum()` returns vector of length 1 whose value is sum of input vector
-   **References**. Additional reading
-   **See Also**. Related functions
-   **Examples**. Examples of function in action
-   Bottom of help file identifies the package the function comes from

# Brief Quarto Overview

## What is Quarto

-   Quarto documents embed R code, output associated with R code, and text into one document
-   An Quarto document is a "'Living' document that updates every time you compile \["Render"\] it"
-   Quarto documents have the extension .qmd
    -   Can think of them as text files with the extension .qmd rather than .txt
-   At top of .qmd file you specify the "output" style, which dictates what kind of formatted document will be created
    -   e.g., `html_document` or `pdf_document` (this document was created with `revealjs`)
-   When you compile \["Render"\] a .qmd file, the resulting formatted document can be an HTML document, a PDF document, an MS Word document, or many other types

## Creating Quarto documents

**Do this with a partner**

Approach for creating a Quarto document.

1.  Point-and-click from within RStudio
    -   Click on *File* \>\> *New File* \>\> *Quarto Document...* \>\> choose *HTML* \>\> click *OK*
        -   Optional: add title (this is not the file name, just what appears at the top of document)
        -   Optional: add author name
    -   Save the .qmd file; *File* \>\> *Save As*
        -   Any file name
        -   Recommend you save it in same folder you saved this lecture
    -   "Render" the entire .qmd file
        -   Point-and-click OR shortcut: **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + k**

## Creating and Formatting Quarto Documents

Take a few minutes and have you peruse the [Quarto site](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) to build familiarity (I still access it all the time when I forget how to do specific things)

I especially want you to take some time to peruse documents on YAML headers:

-   [HTML documents](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html)
-   [PDF documents](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/pdf.html)
-   [Word documents](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/docx.html)
-   [Webstes](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html)
-   [RevealJS slides](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/presentations/revealjs.html)
